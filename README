Standford Lagunita: Compilers
-----------------------------

The course covers all the major topics concerning compiler technology theory and
requires students to implement a fully working compiler for the COOL language, a
language designed by the course's teacher for the compiler course.

Such language - although not used outside the course - include many of the common
features of a modern programming language.

The repository contains code for the four assigments needed to pass the Compiler
course, it does not include the code given as part of the assigments by the
teacher and needed to build a working compiler.

[TARBALLS]

Assigment I : Lexical analyser
-------------------------------
The lexical specification given has been implemented using Flex
and it is contained in the Flex's file : cool.flex

Assigment II : Syntax analyser
------------------------------
The syntax analyser is built using Bisont and its file can be found
at the top level of the hierarchy tree as cool.y

Assigmnet III: Semantic analyser
--------------------------------
This is by far the biggest piece of the COOL compiler, the assigment
required the implementation of a semantic analyser into files

1. semant.h    COMMENTS
2. semant.cc 
3. cool-tree.h
