Standford Lagunita: Compilers
-----------------------------

The course covers all the major topics concerning compiler technology theory and
requires students to implement a fully working compiler for the COOL language, a
language designed by the course's teacher for the compiler course.

Such language - although not used outside the course - includes many of the common
features of a modern programming language.

The repository contains code for the four assigments needed to pass the Compiler
course, it does not include the code given as part of the assigments by the
teacher and needed to build a working compiler.

In theory you could download the Linux VM image from :

https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/info

And replace the appropriate file for each assigment, the COOL manual and support code
documents provided with the assignemnts are committed in the repository as PDF files.

This project is meant to give a pratical follow-up to my university module dedicated
to compiler technology and to show genuine interest to the topic, the code has been
developed during evenings and it is does not claim to be perfect or error-free although
it passed the course's tests with excellent score.

In particular the code mixes teacher-provided code style with mine and it is not really
concerned about speed or memory allocations.

Assignment I : Lexical analyser
-------------------------------
The lexical specification given has been implemented using Flex
and it is contained in the Flex's file : cool.flex

Assignment II : Syntax analyser
-------------------------------
The syntax analyser is built using Bisont and its file can be found
at the top level of the hierarchy tree as cool.y

Assignment III: Semantic analyser
---------------------------------
This is by far the biggest piece of the COOL compiler, the assignment
required the implementation of a semantic analyser into files

1. semant.h    COMMENTS
2. semant.cc 
3. cool-tree.h

Assignment IV: code generator
-----------------------------

Work in progress, not required to get a certificate though.
